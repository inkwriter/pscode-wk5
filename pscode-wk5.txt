// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

BEGIN
INPUT number
IF number MOD 2 == 0
    PRINT "Even"
ELSE
    PRINT "Odd"
END 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are



BEGIN

FOR i FROM 1 TO 5
    INPUT num[i]
END FOR LOOP

num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum
sum % 5 = avg_number

min_number = min(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)

max_number = max(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)

PRINT "The average of these numbers are ", avg_number
PRINT "The smallest number is", small
PRINT "The largest number is," large
